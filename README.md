# umbrella

Umbrella is a weather station based on Raspberry Pi.


## Problem
Have you ever wondered what the local weather conditions are in your garden? Wouldn't you like a simple way to get all the necessary data for growing the best possible plants in your garden? 

We proposed to create a Raspberry Pi Weather station that collects and displays all its data in a very easy to understand format. The device will initially feature temperature, humidity and air pressure sensors.
It will also provide you weather data with up-to-the-minute precision, as well as daily, weekly and monthly summaries.

This device will be significantly smaller and cheaper than a conventional weather station :)

## Solution

Umbrella is formed by three main parts: 
- **Hardware**: various meteorological sensors;
- **Software**: written in C/C++;
- **Display**: JavaScript based web app.
